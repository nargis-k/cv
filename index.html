  <p>Hi there!
    <p>After completing an International Bacclaureate Diploma, I continued to pursue my degree in Child Development and graduated with a 4.0 GPA. I took a few years off from my academic journey to raise a family, in between taking numerous short
      courses along the waywhenver time permitted and few short term jobs while my girls were at school. For me, it was very important that i be there for my family, especially in my children's formative foundational years of growing up. After about
      a
      decade or so, I felt it was the right time to go back and continue towards my Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a Minor in Counselling. Having started that path for a year after relocating to British Columbia, Canada, we relocated to the
      United
      States where I worked and contiued my journey towards a Bachelor's degree in the Cognitive Sciences field.</p>
